The Big Problem with University
</b> </p> <br>


<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px;"> As someone close to graduating, I can say that university teaches you a lot from Maths over Physics to 
Theoretical CS concepts. But, it does not prepare for a job!
 </p> <br><br><br>

<p style="color:Green; font-size: 30px; text-align:center;"> <b>
THEORY IS THE WRONG WAY!
</b></p> <br>


<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px;"> 
Ever seen a professional simmer telling you he learned swimming by reading a book? 
Not a single theoretical concept is worth anything if you don't know how to apply it in practice in real world. But don't we need theory for practice?
</p> <br> <br> <br>

<p style="color:Green; font-size: 30px; text-align:center;"> <b>
BOTH ARE NEEDED, BUT FOCUS ON PRACTICE
</b> </p> <br>

<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px;">
Yes, Theory is needed to start practicing. But in University, you will never really start practicing. I had a whole semester about testing, <br>  
but we didn't write a single test case on our own, only a piece of paper.
</p> <br><br><br>

<p style="color:Green; font-size: 30px; text-align:center;"> <b>
DO YOUR OWN THING!
</b> </p> <br>

<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px;"> 
If you feel the same, start practicing in your free time, start coding bigger projects, start practicing concepts you know which are required in the industry.
Nothing gives you a bigger advantage over your peers than going out of university and having actual experience with what is required in the industry.
</p> <br> <br> <br>

<p style="color:Green; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;"> <b>
DON'T DO THIS!
</b></p>


<p style="color:White; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> 
We are blessed to get so much information for free in the internet. None of your parents or grandparents had this opportunity. Use it.

So whatever you do, if you study or don't study, use the possibilities we have nowadays and teach yourself what is necessary to become a good programmer. 
<br> Be ready to invest into you and your future, that's the only investment that always pays off!!!
